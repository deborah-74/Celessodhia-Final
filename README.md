# Welcome to Celessodhia! Your chariot awaits...

You remember going on a walk the previous night and then everything went black...then suddenly, you're awake and alone in a dark forest. The sky has a green tint, and the brightest star you've ever seen shines right above your head. Are you still on Earth? Are you dreaming? Who knows?
You are standing at the foot of a large door made of three mossy, concrete blocks. In front of you, there's a fire, engulfing a horde of bones, whoich are yellow from rotting. You can hear crows, and a choir singing a very ominous hymn. Further down there is a large amphitheatre, but every seat is untouched.
You can also hear whispers, but there is no life in sight. Only death. Behind you, there is a large cave, lit by blood red crystals.
You are the only sign of life, but not for much longer...
